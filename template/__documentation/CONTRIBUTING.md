### We are proactive
In general we try to be proactive to detect and eliminate mistakes and vulnerabilities as soon as possible, and to reduce their impact when they do happen. We use a defensive design and coding style to reduce the likelihood of mistakes, a variety of tools that try to detect mistakes early, and an automatic test suite with significant coverage. We also release the software as open source software so others can review it.

Since early detection and impact reduction can never be perfect, we also try to detect and repair problems during deployment as quickly as possible. This is especially true for security issues; see our [security information](#vulnerability-reporting-security-issues) for more information.

## Vulnerability reporting (security issues)
Please privately report vulnerabilities you find so we can fix them!

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for information on how to privately report vulnerabilities.
